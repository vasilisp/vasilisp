In reverse chronological order you will find:

- recent experiments, mostly involving LLMs and using Go: [semblame][semblame], [lingograph][lingograph], [wikai][wikai], [aivoke][aivoke], [velora][velora]
- a SAT solver in Go ([Satie][satie]); partly Go practice, partly nostalgia, partly foundation for future projects
- silence while I was working on big OCaml codebases
- older research work, including constraint solvers ([Inez][inez], [PB-SAT][pbsat]) and [publications][pub]
